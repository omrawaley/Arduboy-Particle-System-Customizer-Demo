# Arduboy Particle System Customizer/Demo
This is a program for the 8-bit gaming platform, the [Arduboy](https://www.arduboy.com/), where you can customize the settings of my [AB-Particles particle system](https://github.com/omrawaley/AB-Particles-Particle-System) in real-time, and try out different combinations to get your desired particle affect.

## Features
This demo includes all the latest features of the latest version of [AB-Particles](https://github.com/omrawaley/AB-Particles-Particle-System).

## To Use:
You can use the (Arduboy) compiled `.hex` in the `build` folder

If you're using a DIY/Homebrew Arduboy, the `.hex` would be incompatible, so you would need to generate your own hex from the source code. (Arduino IDE: Sketch > Export Compiled Binary)
